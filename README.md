Fish Port Managerment Sytem 

Why Iâ€™m Building a Fish Port Management System

My motivation for creating a fish port management system comes from a personal place. I have vivid memories of my mother working as a cashier at our family's consignacion in the fish port. Every time she came home from work, my father who is a buy-and-sell trader and co-owner of the consignacion would often express frustration about discrepancies in sales due to computation errors.

The fish port is a fast-paced environment where everyone is in a rush. Transactions are done quickly, and prices and weights are usually recorded manually. This system leaves a lot of room for mistakes miswritten figures, miscalculations, or lost records which leads to inaccurate sales reporting.

I want to build this system to help my family and others in the fish port automate their operations. By reducing manual input, we can minimize errors, improve accuracy, and streamline the sales process.

Beyond error reduction, this system will also provide insightful analytics allowing users to track and monitor sales by day, week, month, or even by the type of fish. This data can help them make better decisions, identify trends, and grow their business more effectively.
